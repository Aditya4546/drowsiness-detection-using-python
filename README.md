**Pygame** 


to get the dataset go to the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityarenke/drowsy-people-dataset

brfore running the model.py file you will need the dataset...
you need to .h5 file to run the drowsiness_detection.py 
to create .h5 file you need to run the model.py file

give the path of the .h5 file in the drowsiness_detection.py file line no 20
